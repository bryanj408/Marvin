# Marvin
### Creating my own "dumbed-down" chatGPT/chatBuddy
An AI alien named "Marvin" that is trying to better understand the human race. The purpose of this project was to get more comfortable interacting between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
This uses arrays, loops, typing text feature, 

 *This will be a continuely updated README.md with notes/updates/changes to any existing code or ideas*

 **THINGS TO DO**
 ```
-Phase in Marvin after ~2 seconds from page-load
-build a function that collects the data from each answer and displays unique response
-format for phone/tablet/computer
-build out a way for the background video to loop seamlessly
```
